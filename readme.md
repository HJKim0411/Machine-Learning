### Defect Bean Detect System(graduation work)
- It is a graduate work made in 2014.
- Use CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) to detect defective coffee beans.

### QFN Solder Defect Detection using Convolutioanl Neural Networks with Color Input Images
- It is an experimental project when I was in graduate school.
- Inspect QFN parts for defects via Convolutional Neural Network with Color Input Images.
